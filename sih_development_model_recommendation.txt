- CI/CD pipeline setup

TEAM ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES:
==============================

Aashish (Team Lead):
- Backend architecture and database design
- System integration and API development
- Project coordination and technical decisions

Ananya (Data Science Lead):
- ML model development for route optimization
- Data analysis and visualization
- ETA prediction algorithms
- Performance metrics and analytics

Kushagra (Frontend Lead):
- React.js application development
- UI/UX design and implementation
- Map integration and real-time features
- Demo video creation

Shivansh (Full-Stack Developer):
- Frontend development support

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
====================

1. DAILY STANDUPS (Every 4-6 hours)
   - Progress updates
   - Blocker identification
   - Next steps planning
   - Resource reallocation if needed

2. VERSION CONTROL
   - Git with feature branches
   - Code review process
   - Continuous integration
   - Automated testing

3. COMMUNICATION
   - Slack/Discord for real-time communication
   - Shared documentation (Notion/Google Docs)
   - Regular check-ins with team lead

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - Code review for all commits
   - Testing at each sprint
   - Performance monitoring
   - User experience testing

RISK MITIGATION:
================

Technical Risks:
- API rate limits → Implement caching and fallback mechanisms
- ML model performance → Use pre-trained models and simple algorithms
- Real-time data issues → Implement offline fallbacks
- Integration challenges → Use mock data for development

Team Risks:
- Skill gaps → Pair programming and knowledge sharing
- Communication issues → Regular standups and clear documentation
- Time constraints → Prioritize MVP features
- Burnout → Regular breaks and task rotation

SUCCESS METRICS:
================

Technical Metrics:
- API response time < 2 seconds
- ML model accuracy > 85%
- Real-time data update frequency < 30 seconds
- App load time < 3 seconds

Business Metrics:
- User journey completion rate
- Route optimization effectiveness
- Multi-modal integration success
- User satisfaction score

PRESENTATION STRATEGY:
======================

Demo Flow:
1. Problem statement and market analysis
2. Solution overview and key features
3. Live demo of the application
4. Technical architecture explanation
5. Future roadmap and scalability
6. Q&A session

Key Points to Highlight:
- ML-powered route optimization
- Real-time data integration
- Multi-modal transport support
- Local Indian city focus
- Scalability and future potential

This model ensures efficient development, clear communication, and successful project delivery within the SIH timeline while leveraging your team's strengths effectively.
