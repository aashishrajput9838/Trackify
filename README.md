# Project Overview
The project is Transpotracker - an intelligent public transport and travel optimization system for SIH 2025. It's designed to solve real-time transport challenges in small cities and tier-2 towns in India.

# Project Status Ananlysys
## Well-Documented Planning:
- Comprehensive documentation with detailed problem analysis
- Clear competitive analysis of existing solutions (Google Maps, Moovit, Citymapper, etc.)
- Detailed team role distribution and development methodology
- SIH presentation outline and success metrics
##  Code Implementation Status:
- All code files are empty - the project structure exists but no actual code has been implemented yet
- Backend Python files (main.py, settings.py, database.py) are empty
- Frontend JavaScript files (App.js, index.js, script.js) are empty
- ML model file (model.py) is empty
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or dependency files
- No actual implementation in any service directories

# Key Project Details
## Problem Statement:
- 60% of commuters in small cities face delays due to lack of real-time information
- Unpredictable bus schedules causing overcrowding and wasted time
- Reduced public transport usage leading to increased private vehicle dependency
## Proposed Solution:
- Real-time route optimization using ML algorithms
- Multi-modal transport integration (bus, metro, auto, walking)
- Dynamic pricing and congestion prediction
- User-friendly mobile/web interface with live tracking
- Data-driven insights for urban planning
# Technology Stack (Planned):
- Frontend: React.js + Google Maps API
- Backend: Python FastAPI + Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- ML: Python scikit-learn + TensorFlow
- Real-time: WebSocket + Socket.io
# Team Structure:
- Aashish Rajput (Team Lead): Backend architecture, database design
- Ananay Srivastava (Data Science): ML algorithms, data analysis
- Kushagra (Frontend Lead): UI/UX design, mobile app development
- Shivansh (Full-Stack): Frontend development, API integration
- Avdesh Kumar (Generalist): Problem-solving, code optimization
- Sarla (Non-Technical): Presentation, documentation, communication
# Current Status: 
Planning Phase Complete, Implementation Phase Ready.
Your project is in the planning and documentation phase with excellent preparation work done. The next step would be to start implementing the actual code based on your well-thought-out architecture and team distribution.
